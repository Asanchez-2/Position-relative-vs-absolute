# Position-relative-vs-absolute
This is very important:

First, run the exercise, you will see both <div> tags acting like default boxes.

Apply the class .absolutePositionExample to #secondDiv and compare results.
Remove that class, and now apply .relativePositionExample to #secondDiv and compare results.

Ask yourself:

What was the difference? 
The relative position is relative to the beginning position of the element, the absolute ignores the beginning position completely.
